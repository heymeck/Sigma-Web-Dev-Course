        // For Example

        // console.log('a+b is ',sum*x); // here we have done the multiplication of sum with x and x is not define it will throw a

        // we use finall in a function so the code after a return line need to be execut because when u return a function the next line of the code stop executing but finally is always get executed after the function is returned

            // let y=1; // here we have declared and defined y if y is define than try will execute if not define catch will catch error
